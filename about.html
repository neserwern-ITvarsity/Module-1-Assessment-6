    <h2>About our company</h2>    
      <p>Nes Boots is a newly formed company,selling Dr Martens which is a British brand of boots and shoes known for their distinctive air-cushioned soles, 
      yellow stitching, and welted construction, initially created by Dr. Klaus Maertens in 1945 using discarded military materials for comfort after a skiing<br>
      accident. The brand gained popularity with working-class subcultures like skinheads and punk rockers, evolving from a work boot into a symbol of self-expression 
      and a staple in various youth cultures globally.</p>
      
      <p>The difference between our online store and others, is that we offer wholesale prices. The same quality but at affordable prices.
      How do we do this ? We buy in bulk and supply the public.We are one of the largest Dr Martens stockist in the world.<br>
      Nes Boots is rated number 5, out of 100 top stores in the US. The price is right and the service is better.</p>
